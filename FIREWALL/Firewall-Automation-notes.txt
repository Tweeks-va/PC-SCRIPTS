## NETSH METHOD
## ======================
## Netsh is a better method than reg-hacks. Registry changes do not apply until reboot or when system is
## forced to reload the netfilter tables.  For using the netsh method below, if you're adding a new rule
## (never previously used), then simply add it.  If adding a rule that may already exist by the same name, 
## be sure to delete it before adding the new rule version, or just delete first just to be sure (or you'll 
## end up with duplicate/conflicting rules).

## BLOCK CMDs
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Web-TCP-80-443" dir=out
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Web-TCP-80-443" dir=out remoteport=80,443 action=block enable=yes

## ALLOW CMDs
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Web-TCP-80-443" dir=out
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Web-TCP-80-443" dir=out remoteport=80,443 action=allow enable=yes

## Full firewall config export (binary.. not that useful except for backups)
netsh advfirewall export FILE.wfw
netsh advfirewall import FILE.wfw



## FIREWALL RULE CHANGE AUTOMATION
## ================================
## - Create desired netsh script (above), being sure to delete old rules before adding new block (see .bat files)
## - Create (or import) scheduled task to block or allow 80+443 out (see Web-Block.xml file(s))



## REGISTRY METHOD:
## ============================
## Export - Note.. it works, but not until Windows firewall re-loads (activates) changes or reboots. 
## The netsh method works better, but this is okay.
## - Make initial rule entry via the advanced firewall UI, so it gets a valid windows GUID ID.
## - Then export the full firewall rule listing
reg export Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters\FirewallPolicy\FirewallRules
## - Edit down the reg export to only include the rule you want.
## - Import from CMD or batch file (suggest reboot)
reg import Web_TCP-80-443_BLOCK.reg
